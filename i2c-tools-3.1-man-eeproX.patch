+.SH NAME
+eeprom \- reads and writes 24Cxx EEPROMs connected to I2C serial bus.
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B eeprom
+[-d dev] [-a adr] [-p pgs] [-w] [-y] [-f file]
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.B eeprom
+can be used for reading from / writing to i2c-eeproms like the popular
+24C16, 24C08, 24C04, etc.
+In contrast to eeprommer which supports 24C256-type eeproms (24C16s)
+this tool works with 1-byte addresses!
+.SH NOTE
+Don't forget to load your i2c chipset and the i2c-dev drivers.
+.P
+Pages/addresses:
+    eeproms with more than 256 bytes appear as if they
+    were several eeproms with consecutive addresses on the bus
+    so we might as well address several separate eeproms with
+    increasing addresses
+.SH PARAMETERS
+.TP
+.B dev
+device, e.g. /dev/i2c-0    (def)
+.TP
+.B adr
+base address of eeprom, eg 0xA0 (def)
+.TP
+.B pgs
+number of pages to read, eg 8 (def)
+.TP
+.B \-w
+write to eeprom (default is reading!)
+.TP
+.B \-y
+suppress warning when writing (default is to warn!)
+.TP
+.B \-f file
+copy eeprom contents to/from file (default for read is test only; for write is all zeros)
